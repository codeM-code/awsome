There are 10@sup{11} stars in the galaxy. That used to be a @emph{huge}

them economical numbers.@*

For all our conceits about being the center of the universe, we live in
a routine planet of a humdrum star stuck away in an obscure corner ...
on an unexceptional galaxy which is one of about 100 billion galaxies.

very good for us to understand that.@*

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an

As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it
wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to
be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a
