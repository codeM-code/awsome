What is it? 

Sage is a Windows application that displays over 4,000 gems of wisdom.  You 
can adjust the fonts and colors of the quote messages, as well as add your 
own.  The quote window is resizeable, and comes up where you last put it.  
Sage is ATM, FaceLift and Publisher's PowerPak-compatible. 

Keywords:  SAGE QUOTE WISDOM

Getting Started Quickly 

The program SAGE.EXE and file SAGE.DAT should be put somewhere in your search 
path (typically C:\WINDOWS).  Using the "Sage Options..." menu selection, you 
can add Sage to your WIN.INI file to automatically have it start when Windows 
does. 

Included in the package 
 
  -            SAGE.EXE, a Windows application 
  -            SAGE.DAT, the companion quotes text file
  -            SAGE.WRI, these application notes
  -            SAGE.DOC, a text-only version of this file (same as SAGE.WRI)

Version Information and History

11/18/1990     Version 1.0      Initial release

11/25/1990     Version 1.1      Added more background color choices 

01/01/1991     Version 1.2      "Find" will now find comment lines, memory 
access cleaned up, PostScript printer better supported, more foreground color 
choices, and even more quotes! 

03/19/1991     Version 1.3      "Find" will now let you search only quotes or

covering up icons at the bottom of your screen. You can add quotes to your 
database from an additions file (SAGE.ADD). You can also order Sage using a 
credit card, which makes telephone and FAX ordering a convenient alternative 
to checks.

You are authorized to make as many copies of the un-registered version of the

that you always include with such distribution all of the files that you have 
received. 

Upgrading from v1.1 to v1.3

If you are a registered user of Sage v1.1, you will need to reenter your 
assigned registration code.  Just follow the instructions in your original 
registration letter to validate version 1.3. 

Upgrading from v1.2 to v1.3

If you are a registered user of Sage v1.2, you can simply copy the new 
SAGE.EXE over your old copy without reregistering. 

Installing Sage 

Change to your \WINDOWS subdirectory and copy the zipfile SAGE13.ZIP to it. 
Type: 

               PKUNZIP SAGE13

to unpack the files to your system. 

Starting Sage the first time

Select "File" from the Program Manager, then select "Run".  Type "Sage" and 
select "OK". 

Adding Sage to the Program Manager 

With Sage running, move the mouse to the Sage system control and click once to 
see the command menu.  Select "Sage Options...".  Click once on the "Install 
Sage in Program Manager" button to install. 

Starting Sage from the Program Manager

Double-click on the "Sage" icon in the Program Manager to start the program.  

Closing Sage

You can type Esc (or choose "Close" from the command menu) to end the program. 

Starting Sage Automatically with Windows 

With Sage running, move the mouse to the Sage system control and click once to 
see the command menu.  Select "Sage Options...".  Click once on the "Start 
Sage automatically" button to automatically load Sage the next time you start 
Windows. The Sage window will reappear in the same place every time. 

Showing the Next or Previous Quote

By pressing Space or Backspace, you can display the next or previous quote. Up 
to 10 previous quotes are remembered. 

Finding Quotes

You can find a specific quote, or all quotes that feature a specific word.  
Type Ctrl-F (or choose "Find..." from the command menu) and enter the word 
you'd like to find.  Upper and lower case are ignored.  You can find the next 
quote featuring the word by typing Ctrl-E (or choosing "Find Next" from the 
command menu.) 

"Find" will let you search only quotes or authors if you want.  Just select 
"Quotes" or "Authors" from the "Find In..." box to restrict your search. 

Entering Your Own Quotes

You can add your own gems of wisdom one by one to the quote program by typing 
Ctrl-A (or choose "Add Quote..." from the command menu.)  You can specify up 
to 1000 characters of quote and byline information for each quote.  If you 
want to put a carriage return in the middle of a quote or byline, type Ctrl-
Enter to go to a new line.  Long quotes may scroll off the window as you type 
them; this is normal.  

Entering Lots of Quotes at Once

You can add bunches of quotes at a time to Sage by putting a file called 
SAGE.ADD in the same directory as SAGE.DAT.  When Sage is started, it will 
automatically look for and try to add SAGE.ADD to your database of quotes.  
After the quotes are added, Sage will confirm that you want to get rid of 
SAGE.ADD before deleting it. 

If Sage is running when you create SAGE.ADD, you can add the quotes from the 
Options menu.  Move the mouse to the Sage system control and click once to see 
the command menu.  Select "Sage Options...".  Click once on the "Add quotes 
from SAGE.ADD" button to copy the quotes from your SAGE.ADD file into 
SAGE.DAT, then click on "Yes" to delete the now-spent SAGE.ADD file. 

Copying Quotes to the Clipboard

You can copy a relevant quote to the clipboard, and then to any document.  
When the quote you want to clip is displayed, type Ctrl-Insert (or choose 
"Copy" from the command menu.) 

Sage Options

With Sage running, move the mouse to the Sage system control and click once to 
see the command menu.  Select "Sage Options...".  From the Sage Options 
dialog, you can set how many minutes must elapse before a new quote is 
displayed anywhere from 1 to 1440 minutes (1440 minutes is 24 hours between 
quotes.) 

PostScript Quotation Marks

If you use Adobe Type Manager and check the "ATM PostScript Quotation Marks" 
checkbox, the quote will be surrounded in typographical quote marks instead of 
the generic vertical quote marks. PostScript fonts, created on-the-fly by ATM, 
have these special quote characters.  If you see a black box, vertical bar or 
dots instead of quote marks with this option set, the font you've chosen does 
not contain the special quote characters.  Uncheck the box or select another 
PostScript font. 

Unfortunately, both BitStream FaceLift and Publisher's PowerPak do not have 
the forward and reverse quote marks in their fonts.  While Sage will still 
produce beautiful results with their products, you won't be able to show 
PostScript quotation marks with them. 

Typeface and Font Selection

You can set the typeface used to display quotes and bylines, as well as the 
colors used in the window.  Choose "OK" to make the changes take effect.  You 
can choose any Windows font at any point size from 1 to 127.  If you don't 
want the byline displayed, choose the same color for both the byline and the 
background. 

Quitting Sage 

You can quit Sage by choosing "Close" from it's command menu, or you can 
simply press "Esc". 

For Advanced Users:  Setting the Quote File Path 

If you want to store the SAGE.DAT file away from the SAGE.EXE file, you can 
explicitly direct Sage to look for it somewhere else.  Add a line to the 
SAGE.INI file that says: 

               QuoteFile=C:\QUOTES\SAGE.DAT

to cause Sage to look elsewhere. 

Text File Format

If you want, you can add your own gems of wisdom manually.  The quote text 
file SAGE.DAT is fully editable using any text editor, and can contain any 
number of quotes.  

Comment lines, which are never displayed, start with two slashes, like this: 

// This is a comment,
// and this is another.

Each quote has its own line, and looks like this:

Neuroses are red,^Melancholia's blue.
"Furious activity is no substitute for understanding." - H. H. Williams^In The Observer, 1866

(If these examples are wrapping on your display, it is not intentional.  They 
should each be on their own line.) Each Quote can be surrounded by quote marks 
(if you like.)  The byline always starts with a space, a dash, and another 
space.  If you need to have a dash in your text, put two in a row, like this: 

"A billion here, a billion there -- pretty soon it adds up to real money!"

You can cause a new line to appear when the quote is displayed with the caret 
key (^). Both the quote and any byline can have carets.
