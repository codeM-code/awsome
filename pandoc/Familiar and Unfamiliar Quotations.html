</p><p>Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities, we didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college! You don't know what it's like out there! I've <i>worked</i> in the private sector. They expect <i>results</i>.

</p><p>There are 10<sup>11</sup> stars in the galaxy.  That used

understand that.

on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own 
programs.
