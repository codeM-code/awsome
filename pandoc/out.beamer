Brick walls are there for a reason. They're not there to keep us out.

Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities,
we didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college!
You don't know what it's like out there! I've \emph{worked} in the
private sector. They expect \emph{results}.\\

There are 10\textsuperscript{11} stars in the galaxy. That used to be a
\emph{huge} number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the
national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we
should call them economical numbers.\\
\emph{~~~~- \href{http://www.feynmanonline.com/}{Richard Feynman}}

For all our conceits about being the center of the universe, we live in
a routine planet of a humdrum star stuck away in an obscure corner ...
on an unexceptional galaxy which is one of about 100 billion galaxies.
... That is the fundamental fact of the universe we inhabit, and it is
very good for us to understand that.\\
\emph{~~~~- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan}{Carl Sagan}}

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an
utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
are a pretty neat idea.\\

they make it easier to do don't need to be done\\

As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it
wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to
be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a
large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding
mistakes in my own programs.\\

Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they

When I face an issue of great import that cleaves both constituents and
