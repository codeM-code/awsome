# sage - the wise person

I just love quotations, Especially the good ones (whatever this might mean here).

Up until today do I use an ancient and small program called `sage`.

It dates back to 1990, and came with [application notes](sage.doc).

I feel, it deserves to be re-done in a portable manner somehow...

I've collected lot's of quotes - from various sources.

And in the web I've seen great collections such as:
- [Peter@Norvig.com / PNorvig@Google.com](http://norvig.com/quotations.html)
- [Alan J. Perlis @ Yale University](http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html)
- [TODO](../todo.md): add references

Thus: The purpose of this Zettel is to consolidate my ideas and thoughts
regarding an eventual re-implementation of `sage`.
